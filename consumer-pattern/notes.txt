for zipkin check pom and props
we can add tags by injecting the tracer then:

Span span = this.tracer.currentSpan();
		span.tag("orderName", orderCreateDTO.name);
		span.tag("orderPrice", Integer.toString(orderCreateDTO.price));
		
		
		for  local testing switch to local services:
		1-choose random localkey
		rpc:
		   on server if server is local set the localkey to the name bean ServiceNameServerBean like ServiceNameServerBean("businessManager","localKey");
		   on client if client is local no action needed for this.
		   on client if server is local  pass the localkey to the rpcclient bean
		   
		MqEvent
		   on server if server is local set localkey  to the name bean    MqServiceNameServerBean
		   on client if the client is local pass localkey to  the name bean MqServiceNameClientBean
		   on client if the server is local add localkey to the end of name of the needed subscription MqClientEventsToSubscribe(Arrays.asList("gatewayServiceMqLocalKey"))
